# Text Based Slot Machine

This is a text based Slot Machine implemented using python.

## Description :
The program asks the intital amount you want to bet upon in order to start the game.
Once you enter the amount, you are given the total of 3 lines which you want to bet upon. You can bet in all three or only two of them or just bet in one line.
For simplication, once you choose the bet amount, it gets applied to all the lines provided the sum of amount is less than your original amount.

## Depending on the occurance of letters on each line: 
1. You either win and the certain amount gets added to your original amount.
2. Or you loose in which case the bet amount gets deducted from the original amount.

## Quit the Game
At any point, if you want to drop out of the game you can press 'q' to quit and take the left amount. 

## Continue Playing
Press 'Enter' to continue playing.

## Plan:
Over time, I would want to make the game more engaging by including the visual aspects to it and make more realistic taking the real life scenerio. Happy Coding!
